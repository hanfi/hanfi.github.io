In this article i will briefly explain how to crate a YourUserName.github.io page and use jekyll to blog.

For more informations **RTFM** : <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/" target="_blank">jekyll Doc</a>

First of all we will start by creating our github Repository:

<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">You need a Github Account</a> if you don't already have one.

Create a new repository called "YourUsername.github.io"

Do a first init/add/commit/push into your remote repo as it's shown in the new Repository window.

Create your Jekyll blog in your local project folder by following the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">Jekyll Quickstart</a>.

git add/commit/push and that's it ... your Blog is online at YourGithubUsername.github.com (wait a minute maybe for github to make your site available)

AND NOW GO BLOGGING !!!
